## Install and open

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add whyashthakker/awesome-claude-code-mods
claude plugin install turn-timeline@awesome-claude-code-mods
```

Run `/reload-plugins` in an existing session, then `/turn-timeline`. Use Tab and Enter to operate controls; Esc closes the pane. Terminal and Desktop Code tab supported; pane UI is unavailable in `claude -p` and the VS Code chat panel.

Try the source without installing:

```sh
claude --plugin-dir ./mods/turn-timeline
```

## Access and behavior

Observes turn durations and counts only; no answer storage.

Module variables reset on hot reload. Diagnostic history begins when the mod loads and lasts until reload or process exit; it does not reconstruct earlier activity. All display output is bounded; viewers may truncate long content to 9,000 characters. Relative file paths and Git commands use the session working directory.

## Verify

Tested with Claude Code **2.1.288**. Minimum documented mods version: **2.1.287**. The API can change; validate against your installed version.

```sh
claude plugin validate mods/turn-timeline --strict
claude plugin test mods/turn-timeline
```

Tests cover plugin commands, pane isolation, both UI surfaces, and the behavior described in `tests/register.test.ts`. Drawing tests validate element trees; they do not verify pixels painted by the native apps. [Validation details](../../docs/VALIDATION.md).
